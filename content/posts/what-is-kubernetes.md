Kubernetes (κυβερνήτης, Greek for "helmsman" or "pilot" or "governor", and the etymological root of cybernetics)[6] was founded by Joe Beda, Brendan Burns, and Craig McLuckie,[8] who were quickly joined by other Google engineers including Brian Grant and Tim Hockin, and was first announced by Google in mid-2014.[9] Its development and design are heavily influenced by Google's Borg system,[10][11] and many of the top contributors to the project previously worked on Borg. The original codename for Kubernetes within Google was Project 7, a reference the Star Trek ex-Borg character Seven of Nine.[12] The seven spokes on the wheel of the Kubernetes logo are a reference to that codename. The original Borg project was written entirely in C++[10], but the rewritten Kubernetes system is implemented in Go.

Kubernetes v1.0 was released on July 21, 2015.[13] Along with the Kubernetes v1.0 release, Google partnered with the Linux Foundation to form the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)[14] and offered Kubernetes as a seed technology. On March 6, 2018, Kubernetes Project reached ninth place in commits at GitHub, and second place in authors and issues to the Linux kernel.[15]
